# Advertising
The scope of this report is to realize a model that is able to predict, according to some information,
whether a consumer will click on an advertisement.
In performing the analysis, we want to answer some important questions:
1. Which model best fit the data? How precise is it to describe our data?
2. Which variables contributes to the prediction of the behaviour of the consumer on clicking
an ad?
3. Is there a variable (or more than one) that is not relevant for our analysis?
4. How accurately can we estimate the effect of each variable on Clicked.on.Ad?
5. What can we observe analysing the relationships between the target variable and the
predictors?
